<h1 align="center">Graphics Programming</h1>

Learning [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org//) is a great way to learn how to use the graphics API such as 2D and 3D rendering vector graphics and create the basic to high-level cross-platform graphics application programming interface with modern OpenGL and C++ such as shaders, textures, animation, 3D, lighting etc.

This repository contains simple implementation of 2D shape rendering graphics with [.NET C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) Forms Application.

## Usage

Currently only officially supports Windows. To run the project just simply find the `.sln` file and open it up in Visual Studio IDE. Also you could check the `Dependencies` folder to see the Include Library for configuration this project, Highly recommended to use [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) IDE.

> Info: Configuration to linking external libraries C++ can be found in [`Configuration.txt`](https://github.com/BillyFrcs/GraphicsProgramming/blob/master/Configuration.txt)
